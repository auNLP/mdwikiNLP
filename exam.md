Final Exam 
============


# Final exam details

+ Synopsis deadline: January 4, 2021 
+ Oral exam dates: January 25-28, 2021

The exam is an individual oral exam based on a written synopsis. The duration is 30 minutes including the student’s presentation of the synopsis project, followed by dialogue with the examiners and assessment.

The synopsis can be done as an individual or group assignment. If it is done as a group assignment, the final product must (i) form a coherent text and (ii) be organized so that it is possible to make individual assessments of the students contributing. In other words, the contribution of each individual student to the whole assignment must be clearly delineated (excluding the introduction, conclusion and bibliography).

A maximum of three students can take part in a group assignment.

+ Length of individual synopsis: 4–7 standard pages (not including code and figures)
+ Length of synopsis for 2 students: 8–14 standard pages (not including code and figures)
+ Length of synopsis for 3 students: 12–21 standard pages (not including code and figures)

# Submission of synopsis 

1. ** Group submission** : If you are submitting in a group, login to Digital Exam ASAP and form your submission group. (The administration has been imposing earlier deadlines for group formation, to better predict grading hours. Make sure to read all emails from Digital Exam very carefully!)
Note: All oral exams are individual, even if you submitted with a gruop! 
2. **Code**: Please include your code in the form of a Github repo link in a footnote somewhere in your synopsis. If you make changes to the code after the January 3rd synopsis deadline, you should push these to Github. 
3. **Synopsis content**: The synopsis should - at time of submission - include implementation results. I.e. it cannot be simply a study plan/design, although you may talk about "next steps". If you make further progress after January 4th and come prepared to discuss these results in the oral presentation, that's great (it will likely help you anticipate some of our questions, which may have a positive impact on your grade). But the synopsis should still stand up on its own. 
4. Submit your synopsis using the Digital Exam portal. 

# Oral exam 

Note: Please note the oral exam will _not_ be comprehensive of the curriculum; questions will focus only on the content of your submitted synopses.  The examiners will be Rebekah Baglini and Ethan Weed (linguistics). 


# A step-by-step guide to the final 



(Based on Brenocon's excellent guidelines for final projects for CS 585 at UMass: [https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brenocon/inlp2017/project.html](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brenocon/inlp2017/project.html)) 

#### Note about synopses and oral exam

Please note the oral exam will _not _be comprehensive of the curriculum; questions will focus only on the content of your submitted synopses.  The examiners will be Rebekah Baglini and Ethan Weed (linguistics). 

#### **Goal of final project**

The final project is to either build a natural language processing system, or apply one for some task. The project must use or develop a dataset, and report empirical results or analyses with the dataset. It may use machine learning or rule-based approaches. It may use any type of open-source or widely available software.You can choose to emphasize:

*   Implementing and developing algorithms and features.
*   Defining a new linguistic / text analysis task, and tackling it with off-the-shelf NLP software.
*   Collect and explore a new textual dataset to address research hypotheses about it.

Different projects will have different balances of these three things.

The key requirement is to investigate, analyze, and come to research findings about new methods, or insights about previously existing methods.

The project has four components over the second half of the semester: **Proposal, Progress Report, Poster Presentation**, and **Oral exam.**

*   January 4: Synopsis due
*   January 25-28: Oral exam<span class="Apple-converted-space" style="text-shadow: none !important; letter-spacing: normal !important; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12.8px;"> </span>

#### **Step 1: Project Pitch (due Oct 23) **

An approx. 2 page document outlining the problem, your approach, possible dataset(s) and/or software systems to use. This proposal

*   Describes the scope of the proposed work, which we will use to help give feedback and define what is necessary to complete for the project.
*   Cites and briefly describes at least two pieces of relevant prior work (typically research papers, but could also be online tutorials or blog posts).
*   Proposes at least one dataset to use or try using. You must learn a bit about it and convince us that it is available for you, and that you can easily get it, and that it is appropriate for the task and research questions you care about.
*   Proposes what pre-existing software will be used to accomplish the analysis task.
*   Says whether human annotation will be required, and if so, how much.
*   Proposes a preliminary experiment to run on the data (this will be reported on in the progress report), as well as the scope of the final total project.


#### **Step 2: Poster session (due Nov 30, poster sessions on December 2 and 4) **

You/you and your group will design and print a poster to be displayed for the department. You will summarize the results of your work so far in text and figures, and you will have prepared a brief (3-5 minute) oral presentation to walk viewers through the poster. (Good practice for the oral exam!) Details on poster submission can be found here: [Posters](posters.md)

More information about the poster sessions [can be found here](posters.md).

#### **Step 3: Writing your Synopsis (due Jan 4) **

The final synopsis  describes your project and final results. Conceptually, it should include the content of both the proposal and progress report, though they will be changed. The final report describes and motivates the problem, places it in context of related work, describes the dataset and your approach, and reports results with discussion and thoughts for future work.

Here is a sample outline for your final report. There are different possible ways to structure it (for example, if you can, you can weave related work into the other sections), but we suggest you follow this outline unless you have substantial prior experience writing technical reports and research papers.

*   **Abstract:** summarize the main components of your work in one paragraph (no more than 5 sentences). What problem are you solving? What is the key to your approach? What results did you achieve? Your abstract should draw the reader in and interest them in reading the rest of your paper to understand the details of your work.
*   **Introduction:** explain the problem, motivate it (why is it important?), and briefly describe your approach. State a research question that your project seeks to answer: what are you trying to learn from this research project? You may also report some of your results without discussing the details of your method.
*   **Data:** Describe the dataset that you are using.
*   **Method:** Describe your approach to handling the problem. This should should include any models you used and any modeling assumptions you made. If you’ve developed new models for this project, you may even want to split a description/analysis of your models into its own section.
*   **Results:** Describe the experiments you ran and identify your baseline method(s). Include the results you achieved with the various methods you are comparing making. This section will probably also include some figures that succinctly summarize your results. Analyze your results (including your models). If you did exploratory analysis or a significant amount of feature engineering, your analysis may merit its own section. After reading this section (and your dataset and methods), an interested reader should be able to duplicate your experiments and results.
*   **Discussion and Future Work:** discuss any implications of your analysis for the problem as a whole, and what are the next steps for future work. Any other concluding remarks should go here.

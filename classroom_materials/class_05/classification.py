"""
A script for classifying IMDB movies reviews into positive and negative
categories.

What you need to do in class:
1) skim the script, get an overview of the functions as the structure of the
script
2) search for 'TASK' and solve each of these tasks (starting from the top)
3) Try out different classifiers can you achieve a better performance than you
did in the assignment? Hint: check of the script classification_additional.ipynb

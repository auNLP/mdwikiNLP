# Class 11: Model evaluation/validation
This is **not** an evaluation of teaching, but rather an evaluation of our machine learning models.

As I have ended up falling and breaking my hand this session will be slightly more focused on what you will need for your exam.

We will start of by discussing:
- What evaluation metrics are relevant
  - Should you report accuracy, precision, recall and/or F1?
  - Decomposition of performance metrics according to group
- What types of errors does your model make?
  - Good for discussion and potential improvements
- If you train a Neural network when should  you stop training


After this discussion we will move on to a help session for the reminder of the class.

**Cognitive Science MSc | Semester 1 | Fall 2020** 

The course addresses how we can approach theoretical and applied topics in human cognition using computational linguistics and natural language processing tools. The course also addresses key ethical topics that arise from the analysis of freely available natural language data, and in the development of natural language processing software and technologies. 

This course builds on studentsâ€™ background knowledge in statistics and statistical programming, and introduces students to working with large data sets. The course builds towards the data science course. The course introduces students to ethical and philosophical topics, which will be extended on in the data science course. The course prepares students for careers involving analysis of text and other forms of natural language data, and for careers involving the development of natural language software.

Expectations / Workload
---------------------

Note: The nature of this course is that you have to be diligent about putting aside a little time to work (almost) every day. 

### Workload ###
Here's how much time you should roughly expect to spend on course activities each week. 

+ Video "textbook" = 2.5 hours 
+ Reading/study questions = 2-3 hours 
+ Group exercises = 2-3 hours
+ Coding assignment or final project work = 2-3 hours 
+ Friday classroom = 2 hours
+ Wednesday live lecture = 2 hours 


### Weekly work plan ### 

In each row of the schedule, you'll see what you need to do to keep up with the course that week. 

1. **Watch/Read** - Watch the videos and do weekly readings
2. **Lecture/Exercises** - Attend Weds lecture and do exercises with your study group to deepen your understanding of the content 
3. **Classroom** - Attend the classroom session for hands-on training in Python programming  
4. **Assignments** - Occasional assignments to prepare you for the final exam

Troubleshooting and email policy
---------------------

![](googlingstuff.jpg)

This meme is funny because it's true. Programming can only be learned by doing. And no matter how much experience you have, it's a process of trial, error, and **lots and lots of Googling.** 

You're working on a programming project and you're stuck. What do you do? 

1. Google it. 
2. Google it again. Try creative rephrasing. There is a very high chance someone has asked some version of your exact question on [StackExchange](www.stackexchange.org).
3. Try backtracking and simplifying your code. 
4. Use Google to find an alternative way of accomplishing the same task. 

Still stuck? 

5. Ask your classmates on Slack. 
6. Bring it to classroom sessions to troubleshoot. 


Assessment 
--------------

### Assessment/Academic goals 
In the evaluation of the student's performance, the emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:

**Knowledge**: 
- contrast different natural language processing methods in terms of their strengths and weaknesses in different use contexts 
- explain how formal analysis of natural language can provide insights into human cognition and behavior 
- discuss ethical and philosophical issues related to natural language processing software and technology .

**Skills**: 
- identify relevant data sources for specific research and applied questions 
- correctly choose and apply tools for analyzing natural language data.

**Competencies**: 
- critically reflect on and discuss theoretical and empirical implications of using natural language processing techniques 
- justify the choice between relevant methods and analyzes used for specific research questions within the field of natural language processing 
- clear oral presentation of complex analyzes.

### Details

0. Sign up for a presentation slot [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbSQU6927fSSNyg5xfSgWSUpIstiu0YUhaDi0ZsBCDs/edit#gid=0).
1. Your poster should explain the goal of your project, describe your datatsets and methodology used, and summarize any results (so far). 

Note: Your project is not expected to be in finished form! The poster session is a great chance to get feedback for the final synposis.

2. Use a poster template. I recommend the [Better Scientific Poster](https://osf.io/ef53g/). You can find design ideas on Twitter with hashtag \#betterposters. 
3. ~~Save your poster as a pdf and email to rbkh@cc.au.dk by **Mon Nov 30 at 11am**.~~
4. ~~Posters will be printed in bulk on-campus in size A1 (equivalent to eight standard A4 sheets of paper). This is a smaller poster format, so please make sure your fonts are big enough!~~ 
5. ~~Come to your poster session 20 min early to get your poster and set up.~~ 
6. During the Zoom session, be ready to share your screen at the time you signed up for. You will have 9 minutes altogether for your poster. Whatever time isn't taken up by your presentation will be used for questions. Then we'll quickly move on to the next poster. 

The poster session will be advertised to the whole CogSci and affiliated community (Linguistics, Cognitive Semiotics, the Interating Minds Center). You will get great feedback!
